## Ansible hosts definition

Host file must be in `inventory/hosts` file

### Vars

```
[host]
hostname

[host:vars]
var1=value1
```

Now in the playbook you can access you variable with `"{{ var1 }}"`

### Inventory host definition

- `hostsvars` variable contain a lot of information about current inventory definition
	. You can access to ssh port of current hostname with : `{{ hostvars[inventory_hostname]["ansible_port"] }}`
