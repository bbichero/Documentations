#######################  Code syntax and function details  ######################

## ngFor : is a repeater directive — a way to customize data display.

ex : *ngFor="let hero of heroes"

The string assigned to *ngFor is not a template expression.
It’s a microsyntax — a little language of its own that Angular interprets.
In this example, the string "let hero of heroes" means:

Take each hero in the heroes array, store it in the local hero variable, and make it available to the templated HTML for each iteration.

## onSelect: method that sets the selecteditem property to the item the user clicked.

@Component structure :

- selector: 'selector-name',
- template: `template...`,
- styles: [`some styles ...`],
- directives : [Component-name]

## Creating roote : Routes tell the router which views to display when a user clicks a link or pastes a URL into the browser address bar.

This route definition has two parts:

- path: the router matches this route's path to the URL in the browser address bar (/heroes).
- component: the component that the router should create when navigating to this route (HeroesComponent).

{{selectedHero.name | uppercase}} is my hero

Pipes are a good way to format strings, currency amounts, dates and other display data. Angular ships with several pipes and we can write our own.

In the promise's then callback we call the json method of the http Response to extract the data within the response.

- .then(response => response.json().data)

- .catch(this.handleError); Permit to handle error
