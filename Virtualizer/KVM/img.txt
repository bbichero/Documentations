# Create img with format wanted
qemu-img convert -c -f <format-src-disk> -O <format-dst-disk> <src-disk-name> <dst-disk-name>

- Applies compression on the target disk image. Only qcow and qcow2 formats support
compression.
- The format of the source disk image. It is autodetected in most cases and can therefore be omitted.
- The format of the target disk image.
- Specify additional options relevant for the target image format. Use -o ? to view the list of options supported by the target image format:
- Path to the source disk image to be converted.
- Path to the converted target disk image.

# Dump some basic information about the image file.
# Includes the size on disk of the file, the name of any backing file referenced and a list of the snapshots available.
qemu-img info <imagename>
 
# Create a simple QCOW2 image file. The disk space used for this file will
# be relatively small but the maximim storage capacity will be max-storage. 
qemu-img create -f qcow2 <imagename> <max-storage>

### Snapshot

# List all the snapshots in the specified imagename file.
qemu-img snapshot -l <imagename>
 
# Create a snapshot and name it snapshot-name.
# This snapshot is a simple picture of the VM image state at the time the snapshot is created.
qemu-img snapshot -c <snapshot-name> <imagename>
  
# This function simply restores the clusters that were saved when the snapshot,
# snapshot-name, was created.
# It has the effect of returning the VM image to the state it was in at that time.
qemu-img snapshot -a <snapshot-name> <imagename>
   
# Delete the snapshot named snapshot-name from the specified image file, imagename.
# Snapshots can gobble-up a significant amount of disk space. 
qemu-img snapshot -d <snapshot-name> <imagename>
