# Install samba package
sudo apt install --no-install-recommends samba

# Edit the Samba configuration file.
vi /etc/samba/smb.conf

# In the global section, check the name of the workgroup.
# It might be useful to know it when you'll try to connect from a Windows machine:
[global]
   ...
   workgroup = STURBAIN

# Locate the home share definition:
[homes]

# In that section you may enable read-write access to the home directories:
read only = no

# To share files in some other path on the system, add another share definition such as:
[ourfiles]
   comment = Some useful files
   read only = no
   locking = no
   path = /path_to_our_files
   guest ok = no

# Add Samba users
# Samba uses it's own password system so users need to be added by root.
# Note that the users have to exist in /etc/passwd
smbpasswd -a <username>

# To list existing Samba users:
pdbedit -w -L

# Restart samba service
/etc/init.d/samba restart

# Try to access the shares (as a normal user)
# Try locally first, then from another machine on the network which also installed samba client.
# When prompted, use the password entered when adding the user to Samba.

# To access my share:
smbclient //ourmachine/me

# To access your share:
smbclient -U you //ourmachine/you

# To access our shared(!) share:
smbclient //ourmachine/ourfiles

# To access from MAC OSX: Finder / GO
smb://<ipv4-addr>/<username>
