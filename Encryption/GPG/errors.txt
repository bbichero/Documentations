#########  GPG ERRORS  #########

# gpg: signing failed: Inappropriate ioctl for device
export GPG_TTY=$(tty)

#### Error when try to commit
```
error: cannot run gpg2: No such file or directory
error: gpg failed to sign the data
fatal: failed to write commit object
```

You need to specify gpg program name to git
`git config --global gpg.program $(which gpg)`

Add `no-tty` to gpg config file
`echo "no-tty" >> ~/.gnupg/gpg.conf`
